1
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:13,138
Вы только гляньте!

2
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:20,645
[Франц.] Ну разве не красотища!

3
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,153
Не самая лучшая первая минута

4
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,697
на велосипеде. Ха!

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,831
Это весьма, хм...

6
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,709
бес-пре-це-дент, бес...

7
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,045
Я не могу произнести это.

8
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,351
Посмотрите.

9
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,437
Аууу!

10
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,378
Когда я смотрела предыдущие результаты,

11
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:30,381
там вроде было
всего несколько женщин,

12
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:33,259
кто уложился в менее, чем 20 дней.

13
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,554
Я думаю, 18 дней это будет солидно.

14
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,350
Не прям рекорд, но можно назвать победой?

15
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:46,439
Это будет сколько,
это будет 240 км в день!

16
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:50,777
Дааа, мой самый длинный заезд был типа

17
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:55,281
225 км на шоссере!

18
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:56,449
Да.

19
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,495
В теории, это невозможно.

20
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:10,463
Я спрашивала себя, смогу ли.

21
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:13,716
Вовсе не с претензией
на размышления о

22
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:17,387
победе, но типа, было любопытно,

23
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,306
на что, собственно, я способна

24
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:23,476
сразу после шоссейной карьеры

25
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:27,397
Потому что это сильно отличается
от всего, что я когда либо делала

26
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,524
И если я решусь на это,

27
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:34,445
то как далеко смогу зайти?

28
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,534
Потом я услышала от Лаэль Вилкокс,

29
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:43,746
что она собиралась участвовать.

30
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,710
Он рекордсменка среди женщин
у нее лучшее известное время, она проехала

31
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:52,463
маршрут за 15 дней и 10 часов,

32
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,465
ну и она собирается участвовать.

33
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:57,093
Так что, ладно,

34
00:02:57,093 --> 00:03:00,805
Вероятно, я не смогу победить,

35
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:01,431
но это ничего.

36
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,348
Как себя чувствуешь перед гонкой?

37
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,601
Реально отлично, полностью готова.

38
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,561
Собираешься всех уделать?
Я собираюсь попробовать.

39
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,562
А ты?

40
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:12,775
Я, вроде как, хочу посмотреть,
как далеко смогу зайти.

41
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,862
Смогу ли ехать 20 дней?

42
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:20,325
И каково это — гнать без остановок

43
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,203
с постоянно идущим временем?

44
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,914
Ну погнали!

45
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,590
Это испытание,
которому я хочу себя подвергнуть.

46
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,302
Настроиться на то,
чтобы ехать как можно быстрее.

47
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,847
Этого будет достаточно?

48
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,817
Чувак, я волнуюсь.

49
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,820
Моей целью было 18 дней.

50
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:02,200
Мне нравится думать,
что это такое несокрушимое решение.

51
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,912
я действительно верю в силу разума,
потому что в гонках

52
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,872
я никогда не сдавалась.

53
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,959
Люди говорят,

54
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,629
ну знаешь, что для сверхвыносливости
все что нужно, это мышление.

55
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,923
И я такая, серьезно?

56
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,509
Это всё?

57
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,409
Итак, гонка началась

58
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:49,289
мы на таких синглтреках,
это не то, в чем я реально хороша

59
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,458
Типа,
все обгоняю меня так быстро

60
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:56,170
и я просто не могу ехать быстрее
потому что оттормаживюсь.

61
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:59,340
Просто я как бы роуди.
(сленг. шоссейный гонщик)

62
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,718
Я так себе мтбшница.

63
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,971
Никогда не занималась мтб.

64
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,473
Вот еще одна женщина меня обошла
и еще.

65
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,475
И я, типа,

66
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,518
Все нормально.

67
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,980
Это только небольшой участок.
Я их догоню позже

68
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,440
Без проблем.

69
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,365
Я так счастлива быть здесь.

70
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:29,954
Я очень рада этой гонке
и так приятно взволнована.

71
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:34,834
Испытание выносливости,
это то, что всегда удерживало меня в велоспорте

72
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:39,505
Четыре или пять часов спустя,
моя первая усталость.

73
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,425
Что сделало меня хорошей велогонщицей

74
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:46,512
это моя анаэробная подготовка
потому что я пришла из хоккея.

75
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,598
Так что я хорший спринтер,
реально хороший.

76
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:53,227
Но это гонка на сверхвыносливость.

77
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:58,399
87ой километр, ох.

78
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,528
Прям полностью за пределами
моей зоны комфорта.

79
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,283
Болтон

80
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,409
Перевал.

81
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:12,872
Я была так истощена
В общем я заточила колу, и снова готова гнать!

82
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,332
Йииииха!

83
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,001
Смотрите!

84
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,630
Только гляньте!

85
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:33,893
Первое препятствие на маршруте
это "Коко клайм".

86
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:37,355
Это три мили пихайкинга,
где мы тупо толкали велосипеды.

87
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,711
Итак, вчера

88
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:47,049
я думала, что все идет хорошо,
пока дела не пошли плохо.

89
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:52,305
10 км от Ферни (Брит. Колумбия),
мы попали в грязевую яму.

90
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,640
Мой байк весь забился грязью.

91
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,643
я просто вытаскивала грязь руками.

92
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,229
Я вся была в грязи.

93
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,982
Я прихала туда, когда было
около двух часов ночи.

94
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,444
Я побила несколько рекордов.
Личных.

95
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,069
Первый день.

96
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,196
250 км.

97
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,282
Это был мой самый длинный заезд.

98
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,450
И вообще-то довольно неплохо!

99
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,828
Записано 15 часов в движении.

100
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,955
И вот что случилось потом,
я проголодалась.

101
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:23,836
Я начала чувствовать голод,
но при этом меня воротило.

102
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,546
Я думала меня вырвет.

103
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:29,133
Мне было больно глотать,

104
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:33,012
Прошло 12 часов, сегодня первый день.

105
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:40,520
И я такая типа, даааа,
это будет тяжко, чувак.

106
00:08:40,977 --> 00:08:42,896
Я смотрю на трекер.

107
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,565
Я седьмая среди женщин.

108
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,817
Ни за что не приду седьмой!

109
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,278
Я собираюсь их обойти, вот прямо сейчас.

110
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,114
Нихрена я не буду седьмой.

111
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:56,452
Посмотрим из чего я сделана!

112
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,093
Погнали, полный вперед.

113
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,803
Я попытаюсь нагнать время,

114
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,055
которое упустила вчера.

115
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,808
И посмотрите какие пейзажи!

116
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:19,642
Неплохо.

117
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:23,271
Бенни такой:
- Мари, ты едешь слишком быстро!

118
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,439
И я такая, да пофиг

119
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,860
А потом, часа через 3 или 4,

120
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:30,820
Я сделала привал вздремнуть.

121
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,447
И Бенни меня обгоняет

122
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,743
Так было несколько раз

123
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:44,375
и я поняла, что понятия не имею,

124
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:48,212
какой у меня темп в гонке на выносливость?

125
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,548
Я ведь понятия не имею!

126
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:57,305
И так началось самое долгое
преследование в моей жизни

127
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,932
Меня опять тошнит.

128
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,809
Как прошлой ночью.

129
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,145
Только вчера вечером это началось где-то в 9.

130
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,605
а сейчас пять вечера.

131
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,275
Мое горло, оно

132
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,862
воспалилось от большого количества еды.

133
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,991
И мой желудок, такой:
дай мне передохнуть, чувак

134
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,994
Я реально хорошо шла,

135
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:23,497
и теперь вот это, эх.

136
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,171
Это сложновато.

137
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,926
С годами
я стала профи в гонках на время.

138
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,971
Мне нравится сосредоточенность,

139
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:43,851
когда ты полностью сконцентрирован
лишь на скорости.

140
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,311
Это мне больше всего нравится.

141
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:49,148
Пейзажи просто проплывают мимо,
как в кино.

142
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,400
Я твердо верю в силу разума.

143
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,985
Это довольно красивое кино.

144
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,406
Была книга
"Насколько сильно ты этого хочешь?"

145
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,742
она реально сильно повлияла
на мою карьеру.

146
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:05,331
Невероятно, на что мы способны,
когда принимаем твердое решение

147
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,291
Вы реально должны решиться.

148
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:11,587
И именно это случилось около двух лет назад,
когда я впервые услышала о Tour Divide.

149
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,465
На самом деле, это был
документальный фильм с Лаэль Вилкокс

150
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:18,010
Я и понятия не имела,
что есть люди, которые на такое способны!

151
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:22,848
Я посчитала в голове
и такая, о боже мой.

152
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,601
Тебе приходится все везти с собой.

153
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,479
И это не шоссе,

154
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,732
это бездорожье,
посреди ничего, среди медведей.

155
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,067
и потом ты едешь в темноте,

156
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,111
и спишь на обочине дороги.

157
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:39,281
Я такая, боже мой, это безумие!

158
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,826
Но это так захватывающе!

159
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:47,540
Для меня это было что-то вроде
ультимативного испытания выносливости.

160
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,382
Я раньше никогда не турила.

161
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,758
Никогда не ночевала
на открытом воздухе.

162
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,301
Я не из тех семей,
которые постоянно походничают.

163
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:02,304
Спустя три недели
после просмотра того фильма

164
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,682
Я отправилась в свой первый
байкпакинг-выезд

165
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,642
Я раньше была таким жестким атлетом.

166
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:09,395
Нужно спать в кровати,
Есть правильную еду.

167
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:13,566
А байкпакинг это типа,
забудь об этом, спи где угодно

168
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:17,278
ешь что угодно,
едь столько, сколько сможешь.

169
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,405
И этот мой первый выезд

170
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:23,200
сильно изменил мою жизнь,

171
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,036
потому что помог мне увидеть

172
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:29,331
на что я способна за пределами
установленных рамок

173
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:34,378
в которых я застряла, гоняя только по шоссе.

174
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,631
Я была так счастлива.

175
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,551
Те чувства, что я испытывала
во время этих велопоходов

176
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:45,723
были настолько сильными,
что я захотела проехать Tour Divide

177
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,308
в один прекрасный день.

178
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,005
Я добираюсь до какой-то заправки ночью,

179
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,715
И кассир мне: "Поедешь в ночь?"

180
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,510
Ну потому что он видит,
что я собираюсь.

181
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:26,931
И он такой, "Ты там будь осторожна"

182
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,725
И я такая [...]

183
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:35,815
Ну, дикая природа, в моем представлении
дикая природа, это, типа

184
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:40,444
"Я знаю как драться с гризли,
чего мне бояться?"

185
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,783
Дорога превратилась в грязь.

186
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:51,288
А потом я, посреди густого леса,

187
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,999
вижу пару глаз.

188
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,545
И это точно не маленький зверь, чувак.

189
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,255
Мы с ним как бы установили зрительный контакт.

190
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,507
А потом он сошел на обочину.

191
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,802
Ну и я такая,
ладно, он не ищет конфликта

192
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,262
И я продолжаю движение.

193
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,765
Другая пара глаз
прямо посреди дороги, и на этот раз

194
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:14,019
он кажется движется
вверх по горе, в зарослях.

195
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,898
Чувак, это же горный лев!

196
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,193
Я могла бы целиком поместиться в его желудке,
он огромный!

197
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,363
И в общем, он прошел в этих зарослях,
и я такая,

198
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,491
просто продолжай двигаться.

199
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:32,371
Не верится.
Я только что проехала мимо двух горных львов.

200
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,791
Не, я не буду здесь ночевать!

201
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:40,504
Ну и я вижу домик на карте,
и такая, окей

202
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,381
едем туда

203
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:46,135
Я думала прошло час или два

204
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,721
Шесть утра.

205
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,431
Я добираюсь до домика

206
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,308
Всходит солнце.

207
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:56,020
И домик был заперт. Но это ничего,
легла на веранде.

208
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,106
И обнаруживаю в себе эту тревогу

209
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:03,736
Я просто представляю,
как все меня обгоняют

210
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:04,904
И не могу заснуть!

211
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,156
И такая, окей, ты либо спи, либо езжай

212
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:11,493
Я снова сажусь на велосипед, и думаю

213
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:15,497
ну все, так начинается нарушение сна

214
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,959
Немного просчиталась.

215
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,008
Я совершенно разбита.

216
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,218
Но типа,

217
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:32,514
если ты не поднажмешь,
как ты узнаешь на что способна?

218
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,933
И теперь просто ...

219
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:39,021
всё, кроме педалирования,
даётся ужасно сложно

220
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,107
Ходить, садиться, вставать

221
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:45,235
очень тяжело!

222
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:50,032
Отныне единственная удобная позиция
вот эта

223
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,784
Это неплохо.

224
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,619
Ахахаха.

225
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,249
Еееееее !

226
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,671
Так, полегче, полегче, медленнее

227
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,966
Как же хорошо тут!

228
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:13,931
Tour Divide основан на маршруте Great Divide.

229
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:18,602
Это самый длинный внедорожный маршрут.

230
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:21,730
Кто-то просто подумал,
было бы прикольно устроить на нем гонку!

231
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,024
Так появился Tour Divide

232
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:27,528
Каждый год, во вторую пятницу июня,

233
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,989
объявляется масс-старт, на него собираются

234
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,075
люди со всего мира.

235
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,036
И первый, кто доберется
до границы с Мексикой

236
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,121
объявляется победителем.

237
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:43,210
Tour Divide не укладывался
в мое расписание гонок, потому что

238
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,921
в то же время проводился
национальный чемпионат,

239
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:49,341
а участие в нем обязательно,

240
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,302
если ты хочешь быть в национальной сборной,
если ты хочешь проходить отбор

241
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,471
для мировых чемпионатов и всего такого.

242
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:59,184
Так вот, в прошлом году,
Я все еще участвовала в соревнованиях как проф. гонщик.

243
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,186
У нас планировалась гонка в Эдмонтоне.

244
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,856
У меня было несколько недель до старта,

245
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:08,777
и я говорю тренеру
"слушай, я хочу покататься на маршруте

246
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:15,617
Tour Divide, недели две, в качестве
тренировки выносливости". И я как бы хочу посмотреть,

247
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:20,122
смогу ли ехать по такому ландшафту,
ну потому что это бездорожье.

248
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:24,917
Смогу ли преодолеть свой страх,
ехать в темноте, среди медведей?

249
00:17:24,917 --> 00:17:29,882
Смогу ли ехать
не менее 10 часов в день.

250
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:36,764
В общем, в прошлом году я отправилась на маршрут,
в июле, после национального чемпионата.

251
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,348
Это было не в рамках гонки.

252
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,893
Я просто хотела поездить по маршруту.

253
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,480
Прошло две недели,

254
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,066
Я была так счастлива.

255
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,192
Мне очень нравилось.

256
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:53,489
Когда мой тренер
предложил мне вернуться в Европу

257
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:57,910
к гонке, это было,

258
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,580
ну это же было очевидно,

259
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,084
я очень хотела остаться на маршруте,
понимаете,

260
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:16,637
я была счастлива как никогда прежде.

261
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:20,557
Зачем мне возвращаться в этот дурацкий
строгий мир?

262
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,976
Я себя так чувствовала

263
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,187
Я хочу доехать маршрут.

264
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,732
В этот момент стало понятно,
что я хочу участвовать

265
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,067
в Tour Divide.

266
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,534
Всего через две недели,

267
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,620
должен был начаться национальный чемпионат

268
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,498
и, ну, я не буду в нем участвовать.

269
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:48,127
Присоединиться к Tour Divide
было больше, чем

270
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,130
просто присоединиться к гонке. Это,

271
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,424
это вырывало меня из моей
гоночной карьеры.

272
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:57,553
Здесь так хорошо.

273
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:01,431
Я приняла лучшее решение.

274
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:06,019
Но это было так тяжело, потому что

275
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,106
Я соревновалась так много лет.

276
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:13,610
Я мечтала участвовать в Олимпиаде
от всего сердца, изо всех сил

277
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,279
на протяжении двадцати лет.

278
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,741
Очень тяжело отпускать мечты

279
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,743
Это реально трудно.

280
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:24,788
Я подобралась так близко, еще чуть-чуть.

281
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,290
И теперь

282
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,376
Я на маршруте, ну и как,
Оно того стоило?

283
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:33,797
Это гораздо лучше, 
и это намного больше стоит.

284
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,258
Это как

285
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,845
отказаться от того,
что удерживало тебя

286
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,680
все эти годы.

287
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:45,058
И это всё?

288
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:49,396
И я все еще могу ехать на своем байке,
и я все еще могу стремиться,

289
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:52,441
и мне предстоит увидеть удивительные места.

290
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,737
Ничего не потеряно.

291
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,286
Жаль, я не сняла,

292
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,955
я только что видела медведя гризли.

293
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:12,211
Он был довольно далеко,
так что я просто ехала, - «эй!»

294
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:17,716
Он поднял голову и пошел в лес, 
Но я схватила свой антимедвежий спрей, я чувствовала,

295
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,802
Я его слышала. Воу,

296
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,138
это взаправду, я готова, чувак.

297
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,514
Ну давай,
Кто следующий?

298
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,517
Хей?

299
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,852
Есть еще кто-то?

300
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:32,522
Я не думаю, что ты вы
захотите проверять медвежий спрей

301
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,399
Он он очень едкий.

302
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:39,613
Перед гонкой я решила,
что не собираюсь отдыхать среди медведей.

303
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:40,781
[Звуки TV]

304
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:44,159
[Новости этого утра, большие медведи гризли
бродят в районе Монтаны.

305
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,162
Джейми сделал эти фотографии девять дней назад.]

306
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,082
Я устала. Я не могу двигаться.

307
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,793
Я однажды разбила лагерь и

308
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:56,838
в своем спальном мешке,
лежу и слушаю все эти лесные звуки.

309
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,967
Now I'm like,
oh yeah, there's a woman who was eaten

310
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,970
by a grizzly last year in this area.

311
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:08,809
So, I have my bear spray and I left my
my bag open, so, I'm ready to fire.

312
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:13,689
I'm like, looking toward the forest
with my head lamp. And IвЂ™m like

313
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:17,693
Well, you're going to have
to close your eyes, if you want to sleep!

314
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:24,324
Five in the morning, this guy is riding
by with his music on his phone.

315
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:27,369
I just like, get up, oh my god, race is on!

316
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:30,080
Pack everything, get on the bike. Here we go!

317
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,581
Good morning.

318
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,251
The first minute on the bike

319
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:37,045
is not the most glorious, ha!

320
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,422
It's going to pass.

321
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:42,050
I'm just going to ignore this
for a second.

322
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:46,805
I didn't sleep very well because I kept
waking up with these thoughts.

323
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:50,684
So now I'm two nights with barely
any sleep.

324
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,854
The goal for today, fast!

325
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,773
Better hurry up. Let's go.

326
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,651
No matter how wrecked I am,

327
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:03,613
I'm always able to keep going.

328
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:04,823
My butt...

329
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,326
actually I donвЂ™t know whatвЂ™s
most painful...

330
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,535
Nothing is painful.

331
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:13,415
The only thing that's painful is the idea
that I wasn't able

332
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,751
to give my best.

333
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,340
One of the trick

334
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,218
that I have to deal with fear is

335
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:29,514
so before doing something that's kind
of scary, you have to ask yourself,

336
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:33,518
do I want to live my life
without doing this?

337
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:39,483
And if the answer is no, I want to do it,
then you have to accept the risks,

338
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:43,779
and to have faith
that things are going to be fine.

339
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,782
So I'm like,
So I'm in my bivy, and I'm like,

340
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,451
I don't want to turn my light off.

341
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:52,079
But then I'm like, вЂњjust have faithвЂќ.

342
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,633
[Spanish] Buenos dГ­as!

343
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:43,046
I think this might be

00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:47,467
my state for the rest of the race,

345
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,511
so I better get used to it.

346
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,222
Are there some grizzlies over here?

347
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:56,119
My legs were fine up to that point.

348
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,580
The pain in my legs,

349
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:03,585
it's quite, hum, unpre-de-cen..

350
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:04,628
un...

351
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,379
Pfff, I don't know this word.

352
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,217
I can't believe how fast I'm going.

353
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,052
I can't believe how they're going.

354
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,428
This is ridiculous.

355
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,509
I rushed to the town,

356
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:55,303
hoping to make it
before this restaurant closed.

357
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:58,348
So I sit at the bar and have a pizza,

358
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:01,309
and I take this caffeine pill with a Coke,

359
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,270
and IвЂ™m just getting ready to go,

360
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,815
when Nathan walks in.

361
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,775
And then followed by George.

362
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,696
I'm getting ready to go, and he's like,

363
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,239
you know
it's going to be raining all night.

364
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,992
And, you know, there's no
where to camp in Butte.

365
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:21,413
And right here, at the community center,
it's five bucks to sleep with a roof

366
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,455
over our heads.

367
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,541
Why don't you just
sleep a few hours here?

368
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:29,379
So he's kind of like,
walking me into sleeping for the night.

369
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:32,257
And I'm like, you know what, looking
at the forecast, I might as well...

370
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:36,845
And so I set up
my little bed in the community center.

371
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,054
But then I'm like,

372
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,142
I had a caffeine pill!

373
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:45,353
I couldn't sleep!

374
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:46,563
I just wanted to go!

375
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:00,702
I realized that I don't know
what I'm doing.

376
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,953
I don't know what's my pace.

377
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,873
I don't know when to sleep.
I'm disorganized.

378
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:09,377
But that's fine, I'm learning, and

379
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,254
it's all good.

380
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:15,091
And this is the beginning of the story

381
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,219
of Nathan and George catching Marie

382
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,221
every single day!

383
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,483
It's game on, ciao.

384
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,986
Full heart, full gas.

385
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:07,852
I get to Wise River,
and I'm just so tired.

386
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,021
I'm just so disorganized.

387
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,441
I don't even have time to figure out
what I'm going to eat that

388
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:17,612
Nathan and George walk in, and

389
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:22,325
they're out of the gas station
and have booked their motel

390
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:25,995
before I even chose
what I was going to eat.

391
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,954
Now I just had French toast and 2 cokes.
2 cokes!

392
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:11,958
This is what happens when I have 2 cokes!
Yeehaa!

393
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:16,254
How far do you think I can move up
from seventh place, eh?

394
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:17,547
Let's see. Haa!

395
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,425
There is no way that I'm 7th.

396
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:24,637
Watch this! Waouu!
Hahaha!

397
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:29,392
And this is the beginning
of the women's race.

398
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:32,353
I was in distance of the third place.

399
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,648
Clear eyes, full heart, canвЂ™t lose!

400
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:39,861
There's Lael and Katia
who are way ahead.

401
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,739
Tranquilo PГ©pito!
Yeehaa!

402
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:48,703
But from 3rd position to 8th,

403
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,163
Run, bambi run!

404
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,625
We're kind of like, all...

405
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,710
in reach to each other.

406
00:29:56,336 --> 00:30:01,424
To me, I'm like,
I could be third place by tomorrow.

407
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:04,928
Or you know, it seems very attainable.

408
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,388
IвЂ™m going to try to push
through the night.

409
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,516
I'm feeling good.

410
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:14,979
It's so funny because last night
I was crying on that hill,

411
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:18,399
with this muscle spasm.

412
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,236
I thought I was going to pull

413
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,821
a muscle in my quadricep.

414
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,989
And so I stayed at the motel.

415
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:28,451
A good five hours of sleep in a bed,

416
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,705
and then today,

417
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:36,167
I stop at this restaurant,
first time that I sit down.

418
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:42,882
And I had French toasts with maple sirup
all over.

419
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:45,718
So good!

420
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:51,182
And now I just feel like I'm fresh again!

421
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,102
Hopefully I'm not going to see
another mountain lion tonight.

422
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,355
I'd be really fine without seeing one.

423
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,862
Nathan and George
left the restaurant before me,

424
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,865
but I knew that they were going to camp
not too far.

425
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:12,370
I'm going to keep going
and I'm never going to see them again!

426
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:15,999
Hahaha!

427
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:27,010
To survive a bikepacking race,
there are three things

428
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,846
to keep clean at all time.

429
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:35,018
You wash your teeth, you wash your shorts
and you wash your chain.

430
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:39,147
Day 8, chase is on.

431
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:42,066
I'm so close, but never quite there.

432
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,985
I'm sick of this.

433
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,571
I'm going to get up there, right now.

434
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:51,659
And it's funny because, initially
I thought this was going to be

435
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,494
like a time trial.

436
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,581
This was about covering the distance

437
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,082
as fast as possible.

438
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,960
But I'm a racer,

439
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:04,172
I'm racing these girls.

440
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,590
I want to get up there.

441
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,593
And I started making a mistakes

442
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:13,389
because I just wanted
to catch them, and then rest.

443
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:15,642
At this point,

444
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:19,520
I had no doubt,
that I was going to be third.

445
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,368
Alexandera is just ahead of me.

446
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:37,580
Like at some point
I was one mile behind her.

447
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,541
I was on her heels,
but I didn't know that.

448
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:48,007
It's been I don't know how many days
that IвЂ™m chasing.

449
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:54,931
Every corner, I hope to see the next bike,
the next rider.

450
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,391
But it's never there.

451
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:05,400
Tonight, I'm heading toward the mountain.

452
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,110
There are two big mountain passes.

453
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:10,405
I'm going to do the first mountain pass
tonight, I'm going to sleep on the other

454
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:14,867
side of the mountain, and tomorrow
I'm catching Alexandera, for sure!

455
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,537
Good night, Mr. Sunshine.

456
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:23,001
I do the first mountain pass, but then
there's this paved section at the top.

457
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,836
My vision gets blurry.

458
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:28,506
I see the guardrail, and I just,

459
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,507
I just can't.

460
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,801
I just want to sleep.

461
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,654
Update on the situation,

462
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:54,782
I am on top of this mountain, finally!

463
00:33:55,324 --> 00:34:00,997
After some hours,
I don't know, 3 hours, of scrubbing mud.

464
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,790
ItвЂ™s been a rough morning.

465
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,879
The view is pretty but
IвЂ™m not so much in the mood.

466
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:11,549
I was really annoyed
because, if I had done

467
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:16,345
this section last night,
like I planned to do, like Alexandera did,

468
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:19,557
it would have been frozen
because it was 0 Celcius (32 F).

469
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:24,228
Now Alexandera is so far away!

470
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,612
She's riding a single speed bike,

471
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,614
so she's not even riding a normal bike.

472
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:37,283
She's riding like, one gear.

473
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,452
That's impressive!

474
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:42,704
And I can't even catch her!

475
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,965
I'm so much better than last year.

476
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:55,510
Progress is so rewarding.

477
00:34:56,761 --> 00:35:00,681
You don't have to be good,
you just have to get better,

478
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:01,891
that's all.

479
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,656
Look at that.

480
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:05,872
Union Pass

481
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,540
is behind!

482
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,834
Hasta luego!

483
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,677
Oh now I have to descend.

484
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,597
And from my memory,
this is one of the worst descent.

485
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,600
Well,

486
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,434
let's go.

487
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:30,855
A few hours of uncomfortable,
and then I'm out of here.

488
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:41,866
I want  a big bowl
of pasta, and sleep.

489
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:47,538
Or I could keep going through the basin.

490
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,248
I think I will rest.

491
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,251
(This frickin trail.)

492
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:55,379
But, that's going to take some time.

493
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,090
For now,

494
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,343
I'm going to ride this frickin trail,
the best I can.

495
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,428
Venga venga venga!

496
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:05,097
Frickin mosquito, man.

497
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:09,977
This guy Nathan, he passed me again!

498
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:13,272
He sleeps in, I leave much earlier.

499
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:16,108
And I'm like, yes, IвЂ™m
never going to see them again!

500
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,985
And then he's like, вЂњHey Marie!вЂќ.

501
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:20,321
Every day, It's been three days!

502
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,989
Now I'm just annoyed.

503
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,408
Because Nathan is ahead. Hahaha!

504
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:30,081
I recommend touring the route
more than racing for enjoyment.

505
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:33,626
Unless your enjoyment, is being annoyed

506
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,878
at Nathan, who is ahead!

507
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:42,593
Or by the fact that I've been chasing
Alexandera for four days.

508
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,304
So close, never quite there.

509
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,682
I was never ahead!

510
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:51,352
But I can't quit, you know why?

511
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,312
Because I'm not a quitter.

512
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,981
No, IвЂ™m not a quitter.

513
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:57,108
[French] When do we get out of here?

514
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:58,859
Slow day.

515
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:01,737
Mud day, sluggish day!

516
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,156
Mosquito day.

517
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,200
Look at this.

518
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:15,543
What would energetic Marie say?

519
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,338
She would say, вЂњembrace the suck!вЂќ.

520
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,674
Yum Yum Yum!

521
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,426
No, it's not about loving it.

522
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:27,471
It's about not minding it,
and not fighting and not resisting it.

523
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,389
ThatвЂ™s what it is.

524
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,516
I think I'm doing not too bad, you know?

525
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:31,684
I just need a coke.

526
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:34,895
And now I need to look where I'm going
because these frickin rocks!

527
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,439
Aaaahhhhhh!

528
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:39,066
I hated this road last year!

529
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:41,986
What's wrong with it?

530
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:49,535
Wooh! That was pretty rocky.

531
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,705
So the next stretch
is the basin, in Wyoming.

532
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:56,500
So the plan is, after looking at the weather,

533
00:38:56,834 --> 00:39:00,087
I think the window is sooner than later.

534
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,591
I'm going to get my butt to Pinedale,

535
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:07,470
get some food and get out of there! Yeehaa!

536
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,472
WeвЂ™ll rest another time!

537
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:14,935
I was supposed to sleep,
I needed to sleep and I skipped it.

538
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,104
And you know what happens
when you skip sleep?

539
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,023
Well, you fall asleep.

540
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:25,071
The night shift didn't go exactly

541
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,740
as planned. I'm too tired.

542
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,742
I was going like zig zag.

543
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,703
I couldn't see! My eyes, I couldn't see.

544
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:36,582
A little two hour of sleep, and then I was

545
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,626
woken up by the rain.

546
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,920
Yeah, I think I got

547
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,464
in a place, I...

548
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,510
I went over the limit a little bit, and now

549
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:51,013
I'm just kind of chasing sleep.

550
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,434
Here's a beautiful sunrise.

551
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,197
I get to Atlantic City.

552
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:11,492
ThereвЂ™s like a tiny village
in the middle of the basin.

553
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:14,995
There was a wind gust of 80 kmph.

554
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:18,833
So I decided to have a little rest here.

555
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:24,964
I don't know how the girls went
into that headwind.

556
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:29,135
But I had a few hours of sleep,
hopefully that was the right call to make.

557
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,845
I'm hoping to find my legs.

558
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,597
We'll see. Time to get going.

559
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:38,310
So I rented this cabin for the afternoon.

560
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,020
I needed to sleep.

561
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:40,646
And you know what?

562
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:44,608
I'm going to sleep
during the big windstorm, and then,

563
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:47,862
when the wind dies down,
I can start again.

564
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,621
Good thing I waited until the wind dies down.

565
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,123
Jesus Christ.

566
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,958
And this is the beginning
of the headwind story.

567
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,643
Oh yeah, the rest,
I think, was the right call.

568
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:22,855
My brain is back on,
I can see where I'm going.

569
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,151
150km to get out of the basin,

570
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:33,365
and then entering Colorado
and here we go, straight home!

571
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,201
Yeehaa! Full gas!

572
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:44,043
It's a lot more fun when your legs
are working, and your brain.

573
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:23,749
Do you know
what's my favorite thing in the world?

574
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:27,211
itвЂ™s to ride my bike! Waouu!

575
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:29,922
Hello!

576
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,301
[French] You know a little tweezer itвЂ™s

577
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:39,890
not just for the little hair, itвЂ™s also
to get the chocolate out of your battery.

578
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:44,645
Because sometimes chocolate
gets in your battery.

579
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,773
LetвЂ™s see if itвЂ™s going to work.

580
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:52,111
Ahh! And there was light! Pow!

581
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:56,031
Always have a tweezer
in case chocolate gets in your...

582
00:42:56,323 --> 00:43:00,244
Hello and welcome back to my Tour Divide
2023 coverage.

583
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,245
This is Day 10.

584
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,581
Let's have a look at the map
and see what's happening.

585
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,584
We've got a bit of excitement
for third place in the women's race.

586
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:07,793
ItвЂ™s a little windy!

587
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:11,547
Not too far back, Alexandera Houchin
on a single speed, and April.

588
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,675
The other big story as well,
Gail Brown, what a flier.

589
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:18,012
Gail is really closing in
on the guys ahead now.

590
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:21,807
She's got ahead of Marie-Soleil Blais
as well through the basin.

591
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,142
She's had the extra rest.

592
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,436
She's looked after herself
and now she's really coming good.

593
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,565
So it'll be interesting.

594
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:33,110
It's not unfeasible that Gail could
certainly get in the top five.

595
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:37,698
My arms are tired, but

596
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,326
I can't let go.

597
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:48,626
And then my sister message me:
вЂњAll the girls are at the Brush Mountain Lodge!вЂќ

598
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:54,506
which is like, I can get there and reset.

599
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:56,884
We can have a full reset of the race!

600
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:59,261
I just need to get there.

601
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,515
But, I can't go faster!

602
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:52,981
This is Nathan, the guy that has been
on my heels every day, and I'm so annoyed!

603
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:56,694
And he finds it funny!
Hahaha!

604
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:00,447
It's all good.

605
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,368
IвЂ™m impressed.

606
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,078
Ah, thank you.

607
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:10,290
And this is our landscapes

608
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,777
Hello hello...

609
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:47,995
I didn't initially plan to stop
because I was trying to be faster.

610
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,706
But then with the wind today,

611
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:55,961
I was happy to have a little nap
and a pizza.

612
00:45:56,003 --> 00:46:00,382
The atmosphere over there,
all the people cheering.

613
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:06,513
There was just this sense of community,
that we were all part of this thing that is

614
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:12,227
bigger than the Tour Divide, itвЂ™s
just being outdoor, riding bikes,

615
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:13,896
pushing limits.

616
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,814
IвЂ™m going to try to ride

617
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:17,733
as much as I can into the night,

618
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:21,195
try to catch up, just like every day.

619
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,696
I'll get them.

620
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,366
And if I don't,

621
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:29,369
well, look at this sunset.

622
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,790
How nice is this, to ride a landscape
like this?

623
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:36,001
Just that, just that it's so worth it.

624
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:40,255
IвЂ™m caught in this

625
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,591
cycle of

626
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:45,052
not resting and

627
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,137
not moving

628
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,138
fast either.

629
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:50,098
I'm starting to lose my vision.

630
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,601
There's something wrong with my bike.

631
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,436
My suspension is not working.

632
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:57,189
I have entered Colorado last night.

633
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:02,027
Now my suspension fork has lost air
so my bike is kind of tilt down.

634
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:05,948
This mountain pass last night,
it was so rocky,

635
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:09,827
with a rigid fork,
at three in the morning, I couldn't see!

636
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,662
I was so tired.

637
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:15,916
I ended up having two naps
in the middle of the climb.

638
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:19,127
And anyway, I made it to Steamboat Springs
this morning.

639
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:23,215
I'm trying to chase so hard
that it's counterproductive

640
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:27,636
because I'm doing these one or two
hours of sleep here and there,

641
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:32,349
but then I'm just slow
and now my bike is sluggish.

642
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:37,062
But anyway, it's 200 km
until Silverthorne,

643
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:43,151
and then looking forward
to some of the best climbing on the route.

644
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:46,822
There is still a lot of time
to put down some power.

645
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:49,491
So stay tuned, it's not over.

646
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:54,204
I'm very close to them.

647
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,998
I can still get them.

648
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:58,125
[French]
The sand in the face, bring it!

649
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,793
Third place, I don't know.

650
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:02,963
But I think Top-five
is definitely feasible.

651
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:06,550
It's impossible that I don't catch them!

652
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,595
Because when I set my mind to it, I can.

653
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:12,347
It's all good.

654
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,640
I am not quitting.

655
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,892
Anything can happen.

656
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:15,767
Chase is on.

657
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:21,940
The good news is,
we are done with the grizzlies

658
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:26,069
and none of them has been successful
in eating me, yeehaa!

659
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:32,409
So the plan is, there's 200 kilometers
until Silverthorne.

660
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:36,371
I'm going to get there, sleep
at a motel, and tomorrow

661
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:40,542
I'm going to get my suspension fixed, I'm
going to change my tires, my chain.

662
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:41,835
Full reset.

663
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:44,671
And the rest of the route is
faster, is smoother.

664
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,632
There's no more technical stuff.

665
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:50,302
So now it's
going to be in favor of the roadie.

666
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:52,888
Oh man, this is knee high!

667
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,431
I don't want to fall.

668
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,310
Maybe I should have kept my shoes. Aie!

669
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,687
Piece of cake.

670
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:28,340
[rider chatting] ...Dave Ross...

671
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,095
There was a fan, waiting
for me on the bike path!

672
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,975
I changed my chain, changed my tires.

673
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,643
Oh my God.

674
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:44,189
I can feel how much faster
these tires are.

675
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:47,234
Well, watch this! I'm coming for you!

676
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:48,527
Bring it on, I'm ready.

677
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:51,363
The view is incredible, look at this!

678
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:55,492
This has to be one of the most scenic

679
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,953
climbs on the route.

680
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,747
It's quite incredible, man.

681
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:04,751
How nice is that!

682
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:08,463
We're getting into the hard
part of the race.

683
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:13,051
If I want to do it in 18 days,
I need to press the gas.

684
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,806
La la la la la la la.

685
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:23,311
Piece of macaroni!

686
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:28,233
Okay. Okay. Tranquilo.

687
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:31,445
Too many rocks here.
Too many rocks for me!

688
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,363
Come on, you got this.

689
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,156
Wooh! Ah!

690
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:37,284
Oh ah ah! Bing, bang badabada bing bang!

691
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:39,411
Yeah. Wooh!

692
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:40,704
Look at this. Waouu!

693
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:42,706
Waouu!

694
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,000
Who is rocking the trail?

695
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:45,751
Is it me?

696
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:46,918
I think so.

697
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,295
Okay, not too fast.

698
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:49,421
Tranquilo.

699
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,089
Oupelaye, oupelaye!

700
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:57,137
Oh ah eh! La la la la la la la la.

701
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,346
You know what?

702
00:50:58,346 --> 00:50:59,264
I'm just going to walk.

703
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:01,892
And if you have a problem
with me walking,

704
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,102
well my friend, this is your problem.

705
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:09,608
Not the line that I wanted to take.

706
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,403
No, thank you.

707
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:19,868
These roots, this, tis is another level.

708
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,244
I'm still at Level one.

709
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,454
Give me a chance.

710
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:24,331
Oh, some poop!

711
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:36,843
Now this is fun. This, I can manage.

712
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:40,055
How fun is that!

713
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,389
Woo hoo!

714
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:44,768
This is my level of trail, Level one!

715
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:47,104
I'm just going to have a walk,
if that's okay.

716
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,901
[censor] [French] IвЂ™m sick of this!

717
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:55,320
IвЂ™m sick of this!

718
00:51:58,323 --> 00:51:59,324
Does it end?

719
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:02,285
I really have all day, that's fine.

720
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:06,873
You know what happens
when you don't go fast enough on a trail?

721
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:11,253
The frickin mosquitoes find you,
and then they don't leave you!

722
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:14,172
But for now, for now,

723
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:16,383
I will take the mosquito, okay?

724
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:20,053
I much prefer mosquito
than having a tree in my face.

725
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:20,762
Okay?

726
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:22,722
I think we are out of here.

727
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:26,852
Oh my goodness, if we are,
I will be so happy.

728
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:31,773
Oh my goodness, thanks good Lord.

729
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:35,360
Out of here, see you never frickin trail!

730
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:41,908
Yeehaa!

731
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,184
This is lightning, man.

732
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,394
I am on a roll.

733
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:13,356
4:30 in the morning, IвЂ™m
half way on Marshall Pass.

734
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:17,068
April and Alexandera are in reach.

735
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:17,819
They're right there.

736
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:20,947
I can see that
they're camping at this restaurant,

737
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:25,243
and I'm almost at the top of the mountain,
and then it's just a descent.

738
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:26,119
And I'm right there!

739
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,455
[French]
Oh look, the sun is getting up.

740
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,581
5 a.m., I was like, you know what?

741
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:32,959
Let's just have an hour or two of sleep
before the sunrise.

742
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:33,877
[French]
Oh, here comes the morning.

743
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:37,797
I wake up, (Good morning), and the girls are gone.

744
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:39,424
Of course.

745
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:42,469
On the top of Marshall Pass!

746
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,475
WeвЂ™re having big headwind again,

747
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:50,101
itвЂ™s been many days in a row.

748
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:51,853
Not the greatest.

749
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,856
And the sun is cooking.

750
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,392
I'm walking because I'm bonked.

751
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:33,853
I've never been so wrecked

752
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,355
in my life.

753
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,440
This is hard.

754
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,237
This is harder than I ever thought
possible.

755
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:46,032
Nighttime trail.

756
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:49,577
LetвЂ™s see.

757
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:52,414
Yeehaa.

758
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:57,335
I don't feel like jumping,

759
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,880
at this time of the day

760
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,675
or just about at any time of the day.

761
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,240
I'm on my way
to Indiana Pass,

762
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,868
the highest summit on the route.

763
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:32,954
I had a good night
of sleep. Well, 5 hours.

764
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:34,831
I'll consider this a good night of sleep.

765
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:38,376
Hoping to reach New Mexico
by the end of the day.

766
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:40,462
New Mexico, IвЂ™m coming!

767
00:55:56,478 --> 00:56:00,106
Today on the menu for breakfast,
we have sand.

768
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:03,860
And for lunch we have more sand,
and more sand for dinner.

769
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,320
How do you like that sand?

770
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:09,657
Now I just went into surviving mode.

771
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:12,911
And I still have New Mexico.

772
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:17,957
But keep it steady and push through.

773
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:19,417
Steady. Push through.

774
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:20,168
Come on.

775
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:22,670
Nobody said the Tour Divide was pretty.

776
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:24,047
One at the time.

777
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:56,579
My nose is bleeding and like.. Ahh!

778
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,458
[Spanish] ItвЂ™s nothing!

779
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,383
It's pretty high.

780
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:10,301
I'm getting a little dizzy now.

781
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:12,095
Well, I've been dizzy.

782
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:21,146
I feel like, my heart rate is....

783
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,201
This is hard, man.

784
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:40,999
I donвЂ™t have time for that, come on.

785
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:45,462
Come on.

786
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:51,676
All right!

787
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:59,684
Indiana Pass! Wooh!

788
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:10,737
ItвЂ™s pretty wild.

789
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:33,384
Now that's a little more fun!

790
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,680
Oh wow, oh wow.

791
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:59,994
So it's past midnight and

792
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:03,957
it's frickin, rocks.

793
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,918
What are your plans for the night?

794
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,086
Is it sleeping?

795
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:09,671
Morning!

796
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,841
New Mexico.

797
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:26,646
That was fun.

798
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:29,607
This is a new section for me.

799
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:32,235
I didn't know how technical
this was going to be.

800
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:35,488
It's like rocks - sands - rocks - sands.

801
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:38,324
It's late, I don't know what time it is,
maybe 10 p.m.

802
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:39,200
or something.

803
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:41,369
I couldn't.

804
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:43,997
I can't even push my bike on these rocks.

805
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:46,791
I can't even put a feet
in front of the other.

806
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:49,669
I'm not moving.
I'm going to sleep for some times.

807
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:55,258
IвЂ™m not going to set an alarm,
and IвЂ™ll continue when I have energy.

808
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:56,593
So I sleep.

809
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:00,513
An hour later I wake up and I'm like,
if I spend the night here,

810
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:03,266
tomorrow is going to be hot,
it's going to be windy. This is desert.

811
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:07,020
There's no source of water
as much as there were in the beginning.

812
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,813
I can't spend the night here.

813
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:13,484
I just remember feeling my legs moving,
pushing the pedals.

814
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,946
IвЂ™m like holding the bar, pushing the pedals

815
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:19,616
but, I can't see where I'm going.

816
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:20,992
It's all blurry.

817
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:24,454
And then there's this sort of descent.

818
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:27,832
And I just to remember somebody told me,

819
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:31,002
when you can't find the line,
just go straight.

820
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:34,756
And I'm just holding the bar and like

821
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:36,674
da da da da da da da da da da da da da.

822
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,802
It's like three in the morning, it's dark...

823
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:42,805
We have an amazing

824
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:46,684
sunrise this morning,
on the crest of the mountain.

825
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:49,062
So I finally get to Cuba, NM.

826
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:51,022
I'm just so tired.

827
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:54,359
Cuba is kind of a sketchy
town in New Mexico.

828
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:59,238
I stopped at the McDonald's
and I go in the back, I kind of

829
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:03,618
lay down on one of the bench
and I'm just falling asleep

830
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:06,329
when this guy is shaking
my feet like,

831
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:07,580
вЂњYou can't sleep here!вЂќ.

832
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:10,750
вЂњYou have no idea how tired I am, please!вЂќ

833
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:15,088
He's like, вЂњGet
your stuff, get out.вЂќ Ahh !

834
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:18,091
Then I get out.
It's like eight in the morning.

835
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:20,093
The sun is already like blasting.

836
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:24,514
And then there's like, some dogs, barking.

837
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:27,600
I just can't sleep here.

838
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:30,353
So what option do I have?

839
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,312
Keep going!

840
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:32,980
I was hoping to

841
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:36,442
put the gas on, on the pavement stretch.

842
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:41,280
But now with this crosswind, itвЂ™s not...

843
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,324
and itвЂ™s cooking hot.

844
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:47,286
So IвЂ™m just managing.

845
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:51,082
I'm riding like a zombie.

846
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:55,211
My eyes want to close.

847
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:58,005
Sometimes I close one eye.

848
01:01:58,005 --> 01:01:59,799
And my vision is a bit blurry.

849
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:01,968
Wake me up when I'm at the border.

850
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:13,646
Where are you going?

851
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,690
Mexico?

852
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:16,733
Me too!

853
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:19,652
Who can get there first?

854
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:32,957
What day is it, 16?

855
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:38,504
I've been on the heels of these girls

856
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:42,049
since Day 1., or Day 2, basically.

857
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:46,220
And we're like, this little women peloton.

858
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:52,852
I mean, there are two, Lael
and Katya are way ahead.

859
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:57,815
But then the rest of us,
we're like a little women peloton!

860
01:02:58,357 --> 01:02:59,984
And I'm at the back!

861
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:03,654
We all go, full gas.

862
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:07,200
Yeah, it's been hard.

863
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,620
I finally get to Grant, NM.

864
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:14,165
It's like, I don't know, 8 p.m..

865
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:17,627
I have shivers. I look at the tracker.

866
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:20,630
April is one kilometer away!

867
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:23,716
But I'm like,

868
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,301
I just need to

869
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:28,471
reset, and I'm going to get her.

870
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:32,600
She's been just ahead of me, you know.

871
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:37,188
So IвЂ™m trying to eat,
and then I have a nap behind

872
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:41,651
the gas station,
while everything is charging.

873
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:50,243
I'm getting, pretty tired.

874
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:52,620
I'm getting

875
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,664
close to my limit,

876
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:58,000
my body is starting to fall apart.

877
01:03:58,042 --> 01:04:00,795
My lips hurt.

878
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:03,589
My lips, my

879
01:04:03,714 --> 01:04:07,093
tongue, my teeth, everything.

880
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:11,848
Every bite hurts, my throat,

881
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:13,266
my stomach.

882
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:18,563
Man, it's hard. (Coughing)

883
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:22,817
My butt hurt,
but that's a different type of pain.

884
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:26,737
I can't catch up these girls.

885
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:29,615
This is the fastest that I can.

886
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:32,577
I can't.

887
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:37,373
700 km to go, ah.

888
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:41,043
Suddenly, I see a red light.

889
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:43,337
I see a red light on the road!

890
01:04:43,337 --> 01:04:45,256
This has to be April.

891
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:47,633
Finally, I'm going to catch somebody!

892
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:50,845
When I finally get to her,
I kind of slow down

893
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:53,180
so I don't look like I was sprinting,
you know!

894
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:56,017
And she's like, вЂњOh hey,

895
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:56,809
what's up?вЂќ

896
01:04:56,809 --> 01:05:01,022
And I was like
вЂњI was chasing you for so many days!вЂќ

897
01:05:01,105 --> 01:05:02,690
And she was like, вЂњOh, were you?!

898
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:04,567
For me I'm just touring.вЂќ

899
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:07,403
It's midnight!
Who tours at midnight!

900
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:12,283
And then I just had to stop to buy
sunscreen, which I forgot.

901
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:13,784
That's fine,
that's going to take five minutes.

902
01:05:13,784 --> 01:05:15,870
I get back on my bike.

903
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:20,416
I'm like,
trying to find the red light in the dark.

904
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:26,881
But, I went off-road
by trying to find the red light

905
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:30,259
because I kind of see it,
but then it kept disappearing.

906
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:33,220
I was like, okay,
you got to focus on the road!

907
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:34,889
And...

908
01:05:39,226 --> 01:05:42,063
Well, I fell asleep.

909
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:46,359
And I didnвЂ™t set an alarm, I just slept.

910
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:50,196
Now IвЂ™m looking at the tracker and

911
01:05:50,404 --> 01:05:54,200
yeah, I don't think
I'm going to be able to come back.

912
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:56,160
That's okay. I tried.

913
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:59,872
This is pretty much the limit.

914
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:02,249
ThatвЂ™s okay!

915
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:05,211
Look at this place!

916
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:11,968
IвЂ™m pretty tired.

917
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:54,260
Good morning,
little update from this beautiful place.

918
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:57,555
I'm on my way to Pie Town.

919
01:06:57,555 --> 01:07:00,808
I'm a little behind schedule, but oh well.

920
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:04,311
IвЂ™m just tired.
I'm just crying of fatigue.

921
01:07:04,311 --> 01:07:07,106
And then I got to the gas station and,

922
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:10,359
I had shivers, I couldn't eat

923
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:13,821
anything other than cantaloup.

924
01:07:13,904 --> 01:07:18,743
And so it took me a while
to try to get going again.

925
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:20,703
And then

926
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,454
I was like, you know what?

927
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:23,122
I'm just going to have a nap!

928
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:25,583
And then I fell asleep., with my...

929
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:31,464
I fell asleep with my helmet!
IsnвЂ™t it funny, the things we do!

930
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:33,049
Yeah.

931
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:36,510
So I think, I wanted to find my limit.

932
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:40,431
Well, I think I found it.

933
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:43,976
It's so pretty.

934
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,686
Look at this.

935
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:54,570
No matter how determined
I am to get there,

936
01:07:54,653 --> 01:07:56,530
that's the limit.

937
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:00,868
And actually,

938
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:04,413
that was the whole point.

939
01:08:05,706 --> 01:08:07,291
It was to find my limit.

940
01:08:07,291 --> 01:08:11,253
It was to see what I was capable of doing.

941
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:16,175
This whole chasing thing.

942
01:08:17,009 --> 01:08:19,095
This is what

943
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:21,388
I wanted to do.

944
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:24,058
Set the bar so high,

945
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:29,730
that you get the absolute best out of you.

946
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:43,202
I'm like reflecting on the journey
and like,

947
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:46,580
I have all these thoughts and

948
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:51,418
oh yeah, there's still 500 km to go.

949
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:56,966
Anything can happen, and I canвЂ™t
just like dwell about the race.

950
01:08:56,966 --> 01:09:00,386
I need to get there, if I want to do a sub
20 days, it's not over.

951
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:02,011
I'm going for 19 days.

952
01:09:02,011 --> 01:09:03,555
Come on, let's do this.

953
01:09:03,555 --> 01:09:07,684
Alright, get your shit together

954
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:11,147
and and keep going.

955
01:09:11,229 --> 01:09:14,732
Because I want to see
the end of that frickin race!

956
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:17,319
Hahaha... Aie!

957
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:30,291
Hello!

958
01:09:31,792 --> 01:09:35,254
It's past midnight, IвЂ™m having a little

959
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:37,423
tuna sandwich.

960
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:43,304
Instead of having a nap because naps
are dangerous, I might wake up tomorrow.

961
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:44,805
What is tomorrow?

962
01:09:44,805 --> 01:09:46,974
ItвЂ™s headwind again!

963
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:50,394
So I have to make
up as much distance as I can.

964
01:09:55,065 --> 01:09:58,360
I feel like brushing my teeth.

965
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:01,071
Ah it feels so good.

966
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:04,074
It's almost like having a shower,

967
01:10:04,074 --> 01:10:04,950
almost.

968
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:14,752
There was this bull,
in middle of the road.

969
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:15,836
He's not moving.

970
01:10:15,836 --> 01:10:18,714
And he's like,
looking at me, staring at me.

971
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:23,260
I was like, well,
I'm not going to spend all night here! So!

972
01:10:24,678 --> 01:10:26,138
I went very slowly,

973
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:31,393
Ah! He didn't move!

974
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:32,436
One inch!

975
01:10:39,693 --> 01:10:44,406
If I want to do it under 19 days,
there's not much room for sleep anymore.

976
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:46,408
It's like full gas to to finish.

977
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:48,619
ItвЂ™s an oven right here.

978
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,796
Gila National Forest, out of here!

979
01:10:58,796 --> 01:11:01,924
Last stop will be in Silver City.

980
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:06,345
IвЂ™d rather not look!

981
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:19,858
I definitely prefer pedaling than pushing!

982
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:24,071
This is slightly over my skill level.

983
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:30,244
This way?

984
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:35,541
Ah, paved road!

985
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:43,590
Silver City! It was about time!
Hahaha!

986
01:11:45,175 --> 01:11:47,886
This is it, last stretch.

987
01:11:47,886 --> 01:11:52,349
It's been... You know
what, it's been kind of fun.

988
01:11:52,433 --> 01:11:54,810
It's been fun, it's been hard for sure.

989
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:59,898
I tried my hardest to chase these girls.

990
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:02,151
I feel like I was just behind!

991
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:05,154
I couldn't. What can I tell you.

992
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:06,905
And then suddenly I'm like,

993
01:12:06,905 --> 01:12:08,574
20 days would be fine.

994
01:12:08,615 --> 01:12:11,160
Sleep deprivation is so weird.

995
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:17,499
There's a part of your brain that is
sleeping when you try to make decisions.

996
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:19,960
It's really, really difficult.

997
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:23,422
The finishing,
the last hundreds of kilometers

998
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:26,133
of the course, it's so beautiful.

999
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:28,969
And I was like, I kind of want to see it.

1000
01:12:28,969 --> 01:12:30,596
I kind of want to enjoy it.

1001
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:33,640
You know what?

1002
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,601
I'm just going to sleep!

1003
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:39,229
I felt like the race was over
anyway, in a way.

1004
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:43,192
And I just wanted to enjoy
the last few kilometers.

1005
01:12:56,830 --> 01:12:58,707
I love racing.

1006
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:00,334
I'm a racer, you know.

1007
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:05,714
It was so cool to be part of the race,
to play a role in the race.

1008
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:08,550
In the end,
I finished eighth woman

1009
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:10,928
and 31st overall.

1010
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:14,807
It's quite incredible

1011
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:21,480
that there are 8 woman who have done it
under 20 days!

1012
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:24,525
8 women in the top 30 or 31.

1013
01:13:24,608 --> 01:13:27,861
This has never happened before.

1014
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:39,248
The moments that are the hardest

1015
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:43,419
are often the ones that,

1016
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:45,712
I love most to remember.

1017
01:13:45,712 --> 01:13:49,716
You find the strength
because there's no other options!

1018
01:13:49,716 --> 01:13:51,927
This is the best!

1019
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:55,889
Another few hours of pavement.

1020
01:13:56,056 --> 01:13:59,435
I really love the road, actually, hahaha.

1021
01:14:07,401 --> 01:14:08,735
Thank you.

1022
01:14:17,161 --> 01:14:19,371
I slept with my face on the road.

1023
01:14:19,913 --> 01:14:21,415
Oh my goodness.

1024
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:23,750
Yeah.

1025
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:26,128
I wake up and I have dirt on my face,

1026
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:29,173
and I was like, how did I do that!

1027
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:32,217
You pushed yourself so hard.

1028
01:14:32,217 --> 01:14:35,179
I was like, I did the best I could!

1029
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:37,598
You did great.
All these people are behind you.

1030
01:14:37,598 --> 01:14:38,474
Yeah. Yeah.

1031
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:54,031
I think

1032
01:14:54,031 --> 01:14:57,201
if you set your mind to do 100 km

1033
01:14:57,743 --> 01:14:59,536
you're going to do 100 km.

1034
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:05,459
If you set your mind to do 4000 km,
you're going to do 4000 km.

1035
01:15:11,423 --> 01:15:14,426
What a great adventure.

1036
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:16,887
When I look at

1037
01:15:16,887 --> 01:15:19,765
how I've progressed
from my first bikepacking trip

1038
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:23,477
to when I rode the Tour Divide last year
and how I did it this year.

1039
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:26,605
There's like this massive progression and,

1040
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:29,358
and now it makes me realize that

1041
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:33,445
limits are not something that are set.

1042
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:38,659
Maybe this is not the end.

1043
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:53,090
Anteloppe Wells, 31 miles!
Wooh!

1044
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:28,417
This rain is actually welcomed.

1045
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:30,419
A little storm was fine.

1046
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:33,839
I didn't ask for a big storm,
just a small one.

1047
01:16:34,756 --> 01:16:38,552
Small storm please.
Aie aie aie!

1048
01:17:07,914 --> 01:17:12,711
So this is it, the finish line of
the Tour Divide!

1049
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:30,854
Currently all of the women peloton,
we call it the women peloton,

1050
01:17:30,854 --> 01:17:31,772
is at his house.

1051
01:17:31,772 --> 01:17:34,650
We have Gail, who finished,
when did you finish?

1052
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,943
Hum, yesterday evening.

1053
01:17:36,943 --> 01:17:38,278
In which position?

1054
01:17:38,278 --> 01:17:39,363
Ah, fifth!

1055
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:41,740
And I chased so hard!

1056
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:42,658
Hahaha.

1057
01:17:48,038 --> 01:17:50,540
How did it finish, so you didn't sprint?

1058
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:51,166
No, we didn't.

1059
01:17:51,583 --> 01:17:55,170
We just went to the finish line, touched
the gate at exactly the same time.

1060
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:57,005
At the same time?
Yeah, yeah!

1061
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:59,633
That was really fun, I had a good time.

1062
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:02,678
I saw some animals,
which always makes me feel excited.

1063
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:04,930
The variety of terrain was great.

1064
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:29,830
Oh hello, it's me on my bike again!

1065
01:18:29,913 --> 01:18:31,581
I just feel so happy.

1066
01:18:31,581 --> 01:18:35,460
I just feel like I'm
at the right place, on my bike.

1067
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:39,464
I don't want to leave this state,

1068
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:42,801
this state of being, of just riding.

1069
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:44,761
Aaaoouuu!
