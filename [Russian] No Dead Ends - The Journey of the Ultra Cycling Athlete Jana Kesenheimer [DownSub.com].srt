1
00:00:37,992 --> 00:00:43,706
Некоторые называют это ультрадистансом, некоторые экстремальный спортом, ну а мне просто нравится

2
00:00:43,706 --> 00:00:48,293
долгие заезды на велосипеде. Правда я не знаю на самом деле, что значит "долгие".

3
00:00:49,461 --> 00:00:53,923
Я думаю, это очень субъективно, мне нравится видеть, как пейзажи меняются вокруг меня.

4
00:01:27,744 --> 00:01:31,831
Что мне действительно нравится в велосипеде, это то, что

5
00:01:32,749 --> 00:01:38,796
он доступен, что позволяет добраться быстро до места, что он всегда под рукой,

6
00:01:38,796 --> 00:01:42,424
будь это повседневный двухчасовой заезд после работы,

7
00:01:42,668 --> 00:01:46,886
будь это прогулка за мороженым с друзьями, или поездка в другую страну.

8
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:49,713
В нем так много аспектов.

9
00:01:49,713 --> 00:01:50,765
А также еще много мелочей.

10
00:01:52,144 --> 00:01:55,852
Можно крутить с минимальным усилием, катясь как волна,

11
00:01:55,852 --> 00:01:57,479
и это похоже на полет

12
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,607
или когда вы давите изо всех сил, пытаясь обогнать друзей. 

13
00:02:02,014 --> 00:02:06,862
В общем, есть огромное количество моментов, которые делают езду на велосипеде веселым занятием.

14
00:02:06,862 --> 00:02:09,740
Куча разных вариантов, 

15
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,243
едете ли вы гонку и доводите себя до предела

16
00:02:13,243 --> 00:02:18,289
за несколько часов, или вы пытаетесь пересечь несколько границ в течение нескольких дней.

17
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:23,502
Я думаю, что разный опыт это действительно круто.

18
00:02:30,238 --> 00:02:33,469
Я никогда не назвала бы свои заезды тренировками,

19
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:39,808
потому что для меня тренировка это всегда строгий план, и она не должна быть веселой.

20
00:02:40,685 --> 00:02:42,143
Конечно, я как-то тренируюсь,

21
00:02:42,143 --> 00:02:46,605
потому что готовлюсь к гонкам.

22
00:02:46,605 --> 00:02:49,441
Но я тренируюсь так, чтобы это было весело.

23
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:56,781
Я еще поняла, что мой настрой всегда сильно связан с моим физическим состоянием.

24
00:02:56,781 --> 00:03:04,329
Если я чувствую, что готова проехать 200 км, то я обычно действительно могу сделать это хорошо.

25
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:09,959
Если мне хочется максимально быстро проехать короткую дистанцию, все тоже проходит хорошо.

26
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,547
И если мне вообще не хочется ехать, то я думаю, что это также правильно для тела в данный момент.

27
00:03:15,547 --> 00:03:22,595
Таким образом у меня выходит получать удовольствие и не терять мотивации.

28
00:03:50,819 --> 00:04:00,379
Велосипед для меня не просто что-то, что мне нравится, это также важный инструмент чтобы сосредоточиться.

29
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:04,674
Чтобы заменить им что-то разрушающее.

30
00:04:04,674 --> 00:04:10,387
В некотором смысле, я могу работать со своим телом, и развиваться вместе с ним,

31
00:04:10,387 --> 00:04:17,142
и это не только социально приемлемо, но и также очень полезно и весело.

32
00:04:17,142 --> 00:04:27,319
That's why cycling is an important part of me, maybe, I don't know, to my personality sounds very cheesy, 

33
00:04:27,995 --> 00:04:34,167
but yes, it's somehow a part of me.

34
00:04:41,052 --> 00:04:48,129
For me there was never a real starting point to my cycling because cycling has always been a part of our family.

35
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:55,010
I can remember getting my first bike, then I had one that looked like a tiger duck, 

36
00:04:55,344 --> 00:05:00,390
then I had a cherry bike and so it went on and on and cycling was always there.

37
00:05:01,142 --> 00:05:07,980
My dad is a cycling fanatic himself, so we always watched the Tour de France at home and the Giro and so on.

38
00:05:08,306 --> 00:05:10,690
It was always part of family life 

39
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:16,028
and so it was pretty normal that we often went on long tours 

40
00:05:16,028 --> 00:05:20,699
where I think other parents would have said "God, what are you doing with your children?".

41
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:34,378
In a race in which you plan the route yourself, as is now the case with Dead Ends & Dolci, you can of course get lost in route planning.

42
00:05:34,524 --> 00:05:39,632
I do all of my route planning with komoot, whether I'm going on a ride at the weekend or for a race like this. 

43
00:05:39,924 --> 00:05:44,220
The Dead Ends & Dolci is a race with five dead ends. 

44
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:50,017
The start and finish is in Bellinzona and these dead ends are spread around Bellinzona in virtually every direction. 

45
00:05:50,350 --> 00:06:01,151
I think all five are on some kind of summit or at least a climb and at every dead end there is a dolci, meaning some kind of dessert.

46
00:06:01,297 --> 00:06:07,574
Whoever has eaten all of them first and gets back to the finish, is the winner.

47
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:29,677
For me personally, and that's why I do these races, I want to get the most out of myself as possible. So I want to do this as well as I can.

48
00:06:30,177 --> 00:06:39,393
I definitely want to feel physically exhausted at the end but not destroyed, I want to feel healthy and happy 

49
00:06:39,548 --> 00:06:47,734
and still somehow strong at the finish line, but knowing that I did it as good as I could have possibly done.

50
00:06:48,234 --> 00:06:51,029
I want to be at the finish knowing I used all the grit I had.

51
00:06:52,502 --> 00:07:03,665
There are many ways to tackle this adventure: my challenge is to connect these checkpoints as fast as possible and get back to the finish

52
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:13,590
and that's why I will be on the road for about 500 km and 9000 meters of elevation which I find exactly the distance and elevation that you can do in one day.

53
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:23,932
That's kind of the appeal of maybe doing it in 24 hours, which is ambitious. Actually I don't know if I can do it but I know it's theoretically possible.

54
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:34,025
When it comes to the Dead Ends, I don't worry too much about food. There are "dolci" at every checkpoint and you can carry enough food on you for the 24 hours that it's actually enough.

55
00:07:34,266 --> 00:07:43,158
I'm going to cook potatoes and take them with me and then lots of gummy bears and chocolate. You can pack in so much that I think it will be enough for the race time.

56
00:07:43,865 --> 00:07:58,088
In general, not just in the races, it has simply become my motto that I don't forbid myself anything, also in everyday life, if I feel like doing something and if I feel like eating a whole bar of chocolate, then I do it.

57
00:07:58,295 --> 00:08:03,884
 I think that's just a little bit due to my past and I'm definitely not going to deny myself anything during a race.

58
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:07,387
...Frosting is the best thing about cheesecake.

59
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,890
You could have also written Frosting with cake.

60
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:14,727
Yes. Actually all I need is the frosting.
And a carrot to go with it. For dipping.

61
00:08:56,751 --> 00:09:05,814
At the start of the race there is always a very special atmosphere. There is such a tension in the air and you can tell that everyone, even the toughest people, 

62
00:09:05,814 --> 00:09:11,861
also if I know them well, is a bit nervous and asks questions or adjusts something on the bike.

63
00:09:11,861 --> 00:09:17,199
Everyone is talking about what the weather is going to be like and you just notice that there is something in the air. 

64
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:31,003
When you set off, what I like most is when I'm alone for the first time and have this expectation of what's going to happen and I think that's the coolest feeling during a race.

65
00:09:31,525 --> 00:09:37,133
It's a mixture of respect, I wouldn't say fear but definitely respect. 

66
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:47,684
There is also a bit of curiosity about what is going to happen but also a great joy that you don't have to do anything else except ride your bike, 

67
00:09:47,856 --> 00:09:54,690
and the good feeling of being able to show that you have prepared and being able to give it your all right now.

68
00:09:58,829 --> 00:10:02,968
[Music]

69
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,400
In everyday life it's mostly about functioning somehow, maintaining social relationships, with colleagues and so on.

70
00:10:44,676 --> 00:10:48,946
 In everyday life, you are this tough, friendly and, best of all, good-humored person. 

71
00:10:49,153 --> 00:11:00,540
On the bike, especially with yourself, you don't have to please anyone or, I don't know, you can just be happy with yourself. 

72
00:11:00,843 --> 00:11:13,926
And then that thin skin that you get when you ride a bike for a very long time, that supports it. So I feel very liberated, not just where I'm going, but also emotionally.

73
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:17,631
[Music]

74
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:46,163
This is a help for the riders, so they can find the correct route

75
00:11:47,163 --> 00:11:56,005
and don't get lost in the wilderness.
That's why we've painted this little signpost on the road.  

76
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,095
Is there coffee? Or tea?

77
00:12:04,543 --> 00:12:06,054
Where is the Dolci?

78
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:17,284
Ahhh

79
00:12:18,215 --> 00:12:20,401
Jana Kesenheimer? Exactly.

80
00:12:21,334 --> 00:12:24,322
I've already marked you. I thought you were coming soon.

81
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,415
Is that yours? Yes. Uh. Thanks. Good.

82
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,304
Don't stress.

83
00:13:04,065 --> 00:13:05,274
Ciao.

84
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:47,436
I now realized in retrospect that this probably happened to several people because the section where you turn into the castle is too short and the navigation,

85
00:13:47,436 --> 00:13:53,358
If you don't look at it at that exact moment, simply continues without you having ridden into the castle. 

86
00:13:53,530 --> 00:14:03,617
And it also happened to me. In any case, I rode the course and then about three quarters of the way through I noticed: there were photos of a castle somewhere, at what time is it actually coming? 

87
00:14:03,617 --> 00:14:09,372
Then I looked at the map quickly and saw that I already passed it. Otherwise, I rode the course correctly. .

88
00:14:09,372 --> 00:14:17,254
Then I briefly thought about whether I should go back on the same direction, including the castle, or whether I should take the route as planned 

89
00:14:17,254 --> 00:14:27,346
and then basically catch up on the castle. I took a quick look at the rules and the rules stated: every part of the course must be in the route and the direction doesn't matter.

90
00:14:27,346 --> 00:14:36,855
So I decided that I would go back and "catch up" with the castle and then continue my route. I found out two or three others did it the same way as I did. 

91
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:46,030
So it calmed me down a bit because that mistake kept me quite busy in my head, because route finding isn't a big strength of mine.

92
00:15:01,661 --> 00:15:11,188
It's a bit of ME-time.
I'm happy to make these decisions on my own, to ride my bike just for myself. Of course I'm happy when I meet someone along the road,

93
00:15:11,188 --> 00:15:23,146
 but even then we usually ride together for a very short time and I personally think that's a good thing. I like to be alone and it is also a conscious decision to start these races solo.

94
00:15:23,146 --> 00:15:34,572
 I actually admire the pairs where it works well. I imagine this would be quite difficult for me. For me and maybe for the other person as well.

95
00:15:37,942 --> 00:15:48,626
It would be easier for me if I were the weaker part. Then I wouldn't have to make any compromises in terms of performance.

96
00:15:48,867 --> 00:16:03,473
 It would be harder for me if I started with someone who was worse, because in a race like this, where I start to ride as well as I can, I wouldn't be able to achieve that goal. 

97
00:16:15,383 --> 00:16:18,982
Ahh, the climb was pretty hectic.

98
00:16:43,925 --> 00:16:48,429
Great work! Have you ridden through the snow?
That's the question I ask everyone who comes up here.

99
00:16:49,782 --> 00:16:51,135
Like you've been here forever... [laugh]

100
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:54,651
It's like a bag of coke.

101
00:16:54,651 --> 00:16:56,436
There wasn't a smaller zipper bag, right?

102
00:16:58,662 --> 00:16:59,564
Enjoy!

103
00:17:00,563 --> 00:17:02,412
They get nice and warm on the back too, right?

104
00:17:02,412 --> 00:17:03,641
Yes, perfect!

105
00:17:06,607 --> 00:17:08,195
There's "Dolci" down there.

106
00:17:08,367 --> 00:17:11,031
Yes, but you have to go down quite a bit and then up again.

107
00:17:11,203 --> 00:17:13,232
Is it much? I do not know.

108
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:14,787
That's where the guy on the gravel bike turned off.

109
00:17:14,787 --> 00:17:16,078
Oh well, you probably haven't seen him.

110
00:17:16,499 --> 00:17:18,654
I think it was exactly where this piece of gravel started.

111
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,998
I mean at 8800 meters of elevation it doesn't matter anymore.
Yes, if you have signed up for Dead Ends & Dolci...

112
00:17:25,334 --> 00:17:26,978
Ah, I thinks it was pretty hard work coming up here.

113
00:17:27,952 --> 00:17:28,839
See you soon.

114
00:17:29,085 --> 00:17:30,591
See you soon!

115
00:17:34,108 --> 00:17:35,949
[Music]

116
00:17:37,846 --> 00:17:42,393
Oh cool, This will definitely mean "Dolci" at the end. Right?

117
00:17:43,255 --> 00:17:44,117
What?

118
00:17:44,358 --> 00:17:45,411
These are letters.

119
00:17:46,157 --> 00:17:48,732
Ahhh... Martin, I hope you got it.

120
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:59,033
I felt really fit the whole time, really good, and then halfway up here I suddenly had a terrible stomach ache

121
00:17:59,205 --> 00:18:02,202
then I stopped briefly. I don't know.

122
00:18:05,624 --> 00:18:10,167
That was definitely the worst moment so far.
It was also just incredibly steep.

123
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:17,927
[Music]

124
00:19:22,276 --> 00:19:35,100
It takes about two or three hours until I feel like I've arrived and then cycling works a little by itself and you look around or maybe have little encounters with other people

125
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:44,630
or just realize how nature changes, how the time of day changes. Things happen in the environment which you wouldn't otherwise notice in your everyday life.

126
00:19:45,113 --> 00:19:51,734
You focus on the present moment and on the problems that are important at the moment, I think that's special.

127
00:19:52,251 --> 00:20:02,683
You no longer think about everyday life, let alone the race situation or anything else, but are just so focused on the present moment.

128
00:20:04,873 --> 00:20:13,744
For example, in the Pyrenees last fall, there were wild horses and I stopped to take a photo and one of these horses came up to me

129
00:20:13,744 --> 00:20:21,839
and nudged me, it was just so magically cheesy, exactly as it sounds, that's how it was. I just started crying because it was so beautiful.

130
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:32,357
That is one of these special moments which are rare in everyday life.

131
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:36,547
[Music]

132
00:21:59,794 --> 00:22:06,459
I think I'm just an extremely strong-willed person. Well, it kind of started with me being a crybaby and I think my parents,

133
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:11,386
had a bit of trouble with me because I was probably a very emotional and strong-willed baby.

134
00:22:11,558 --> 00:22:19,684
Then unfortunately I had a time in my youth that was very destructive. I did well at school, had lots of friends, and felt very comfortable.

135
00:22:20,207 --> 00:22:29,226
I've always done sports which felt great.
At some point, my family gave up sweets for Lent

136
00:22:29,226 --> 00:22:41,474
and unfortunately this became my new craze, so to speak. I started not eating sweets anymore, which eventually ended in two years of anorexia.

137
00:22:41,646 --> 00:22:45,994
It was an extremely educational and also a very difficult time for me.

138
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:48,231
How should I say...

139
00:22:49,876 --> 00:22:53,873
I found a way out of it, more or less on my own,

140
00:22:54,739 --> 00:22:59,703
and I'm actually pretty proud of it to this day.

141
00:22:59,703 --> 00:23:04,676
I think it shaped me and made me the person I am today.

142
00:23:06,642 --> 00:23:13,206
I was trying to do something (my diet) perfectly

143
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:24,952
but I realized that paying extreme attention to your diet is anything but perfect.
At least in that situation. It was definitely the wrong challenge.

144
00:23:25,573 --> 00:23:37,078
It shaped me until I was 18 and after that I was looking for absolute freedom, because of course not eating anything restricts you extremely.

145
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:46,327
And I was obviously very good at not eating. Thank God I managed to eat again and then I partied and went out a lot.

146
00:23:46,327 --> 00:23:53,843
I lived in this realm of freedom for two or three years and used every bit of freedom that I had and took it to the extreme.

147
00:23:54,126 --> 00:24:01,189
But the sport was always part of my life. Even during this party time, I always went running and ran marathons and stuff.

148
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:04,612
But I was also awake all night long in Berlin clubs and bars.

149
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,301
This was also an important time for me, I think.

150
00:24:07,508 --> 00:24:17,713
But I then realized that sport was a way to feel myself and push my limits in a way that was not only socially accepted,

151
00:24:17,713 --> 00:24:20,118
but also in a way that was good and healthy for me personally. 

152
00:24:20,402 --> 00:24:27,258
In a way that is not harmimg my body by partying, drinking and sleep deprivation or by not eating anything.

153
00:24:27,397 --> 00:24:38,799
But rather by simply reaching for my limits in sport and exercise in such a way that it is healthy and in a social way training together with friends.

154
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:49,431
I think that's how I've managed to use cycling for myself in such a way that I can embrace this personality that I carry with me...

155
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,680
I used to think maybe this was a bad thing,

156
00:24:52,163 --> 00:24:58,089
always having to take things to the extreme, or that I really enjoy to push the limits,

157
00:24:58,089 --> 00:25:01,888
but today I actually see something extremely positive in it.

158
00:25:02,475 --> 00:25:04,538
[Music]

159
00:25:45,376 --> 00:25:50,132
This is the penultimate climb,
And also the penultimate checkpoint.

160
00:25:53,684 --> 00:26:00,183
I now have ridden 349 km and 7007 meters of altitude.

161
00:26:02,838 --> 00:26:07,120
That means there are still 1800 meters of altitude to go.

162
00:26:09,706 --> 00:26:10,665
Yes.

163
00:26:12,217 --> 00:26:25,599
I went to pee twice and my pants have a magnet in the back, which is really cool because you can go pee really quickly but then I couldn't reach it anymore.

164
00:26:26,116 --> 00:26:30,260
I probably swore and stood there for 20 minutes.

165
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:33,029
Certainly no woman came up with this design, really.

166
00:26:33,822 --> 00:26:40,298
I feel a bit of pain in my right knee, where I had inflammation last year. 
But I think it's justifiable.

167
00:26:43,665 --> 00:26:47,834
I think I eat a bit too little, but I also felt sick twice today.

168
00:26:48,454 --> 00:26:50,652
I don't think I can eat "Dolci" at all right now.

169
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,593
I feel more like potatoes.

170
00:26:53,834 --> 00:26:55,282
I have two more.

171
00:27:00,835 --> 00:27:03,111
Wow, so beautiful!

172
00:27:04,732 --> 00:27:05,611
Hi.

173
00:27:05,922 --> 00:27:07,708
You have a great setup.

174
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:08,842
Yes.

175
00:27:08,842 --> 00:27:10,643
I was bike-packing here in February

176
00:27:10,953 --> 00:27:13,177
and then I already knew that I will be coming to this location

177
00:27:13,177 --> 00:27:19,621
And I thought: "Oh God, the volunteers who are getting dropped off here." [Laughter]

178
00:27:27,762 --> 00:27:28,882
Hey cool.

179
00:27:29,537 --> 00:27:30,037
Thanks.

180
00:27:30,209 --> 00:27:30,881
One more.

181
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:31,937
Yes.

182
00:27:36,593 --> 00:27:38,159
Ah and now I have a problem.

183
00:27:42,479 --> 00:27:44,263
Wow, I still have so much food left.

184
00:27:52,821 --> 00:27:56,124
Yes, I have the same problem.
I need to try something salty now.

185
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,389
They have tea if you want.

186
00:28:14,518 --> 00:28:16,429
Ciao. Ciao-Ciao. Bye.

187
00:28:17,464 --> 00:28:18,908
See you later Max. - See you later.

188
00:28:55,709 --> 00:29:03,614
In a race, I set off at night and it's cold, it's dark, you're really focused on the three to four meters in front of you.

189
00:29:03,614 --> 00:29:06,965
The focus area is very small, just the light beam of the lamp.

190
00:29:08,069 --> 00:29:12,565
It is very quiet and there is hardly any traffic. I like riding bike at night

191
00:29:12,565 --> 00:29:15,161
and despite it there is still a certain tension in your body.

192
00:29:25,876 --> 00:29:28,745
[Music]

193
00:30:01,126 --> 00:30:01,842
Is this the last one?

194
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,480
Yes.

195
00:30:06,342 --> 00:30:08,075
I am sure it means “Dulci”.

196
00:30:09,696 --> 00:30:11,633
- I would say "Dölci".

197
00:30:13,082 --> 00:30:15,524
Well, I already felt worse today.

198
00:30:16,145 --> 00:30:18,153
Do you fancy an apple strudel?

199
00:30:18,946 --> 00:30:19,998
Yeah...

200
00:30:20,377 --> 00:30:25,136
wait, I still have the "Dolci" from the last checkpoint.

201
00:30:25,377 --> 00:30:28,462
[laughter]

202
00:30:28,634 --> 00:30:30,277
I'll eat that first.

203
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:40,911
Now I just need to ride home.

204
00:30:42,566 --> 00:30:44,271
68 kilometers, yes

205
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,663
and another 800 meters in altitude.

206
00:30:53,024 --> 00:30:55,459
At 5 o'clock the radar is definitely showing rain.

207
00:31:04,684 --> 00:31:06,968
And I think the nausea I've experienced

208
00:31:07,576 --> 00:31:10,000
was due to the fact that I didn't drink enough.

209
00:31:20,557 --> 00:31:22,305
Do you take turns sleeping?

210
00:31:22,305 --> 00:31:22,841
Yes.

211
00:31:23,358 --> 00:31:25,376
Yes, we'll go to bed right now.

212
00:31:51,186 --> 00:31:52,325
Ciao.

213
00:31:56,739 --> 00:32:00,469
For me it's just the greatest satisfaction.

214
00:32:00,814 --> 00:32:05,225
It's not really euphoric or anything like that,

215
00:32:05,225 --> 00:32:10,232
I'm just happy with myself when I've given it my all.

216
00:32:11,336 --> 00:32:22,251
It just feels good, not really too good or whatever, no rush or anything like that, but I'm just happy.

217
00:32:23,183 --> 00:32:23,887
How are you?

218
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:24,726
Good.

219
00:32:25,105 --> 00:32:27,650
I really wanted to finish within 24 hours.

220
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:28,478
Did you?

221
00:32:28,478 --> 00:32:29,071
Yes.

222
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:31,616
Amazing. Great. 

223
00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:39,125
Twenty minutes to 6 o´clock I thought: Oh fuck, now I have to...

224
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,790
Yes hey, you still get the most important stamp of all.

225
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:44,414
Ah yes.

226
00:32:49,035 --> 00:32:50,597
Ah, there's another one.

227
00:32:50,597 --> 00:32:51,823
Yep, the best.

228
00:32:53,547 --> 00:32:54,149
Wow.

229
00:32:56,804 --> 00:32:58,686
Do you like it with cake or without?

230
00:32:59,065 --> 00:33:02,257
I can´t. [Laughter]

231
00:33:02,498 --> 00:33:07,126
But do you like soup? Or a beer? Or a coke? Or a bed? 

232
00:33:07,712 --> 00:33:09,639
Do you really have a soup? That would be great.

233
00:33:10,584 --> 00:33:13,079
Just under 24 hours...

234
00:33:13,389 --> 00:33:15,912
is really fast compared to last year.

235
00:33:16,498 --> 00:33:18,251
but well, there was the rain.

236
00:33:18,494 --> 00:33:22,842
At some point it felt like:
I'll be happy when it's over

237
00:33:25,744 --> 00:33:27,778
but now at the end it went really quickly again.

238
00:33:27,778 --> 00:33:31,267
At the last checkpoint I thought: Wow, this will probably take another three hours, 

239
00:33:31,957 --> 00:33:33,244
but then it went quickly.

240
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:41,107
I had some liquor with me, just in case...

241
00:33:41,459 --> 00:33:44,201
[laughter]

242
00:33:44,543 --> 00:33:47,168
Yes, I still have some. A whole pack of M&Ms.

243
00:33:48,582 --> 00:33:49,796
Yes, then you can drive again tomorrow.

244
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,628
Yes, I think they'll get eaten soon.

245
00:33:54,145 --> 00:33:55,976
Okay, I'll lie down.

246
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:25,589
I think it's really nice to spend time at the finish

247
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:31,459
to greet everyone else who arrives and to be able to feel a little bit of these arrivals. 

248
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:36,501
The emotions that are part of it are nice to see.

249
00:34:57,379 --> 00:35:00,819
So actually quite a lot of people send me questions on Instagram 

250
00:35:00,991 --> 00:35:03,588
and a lot of questions, focus on:

251
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:13,459
how do you train or how do you motivate yourself to get on the bike again and again and how do you manage to get on the bike even in bad weather?

252
00:35:14,735 --> 00:35:19,767
I don't know, it maybe sounds really stupid but,
The question somehow doesn't arise for me.

253
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,658
I'm just always psyched.
